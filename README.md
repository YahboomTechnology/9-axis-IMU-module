# Yahboom IMU 9-Axis Inertial Navigation Module ARHS Sensor
![](https://github.com/YahboomTechnology/9-axis-IMU-module/blob/main/IMU.jpg)
# Introduction
This is a high-precision inertial measurement module that integrates 3-axis gyroscope, 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis magnetometer, and a thermometer. The baud rate is 921600, the return rate can reach 400Hz. Built-in algorithm can stably acquire and output data such as magnetic field vector, acceleration, gyroscope, and quaternion. It supports USB/UART/CAN/SPI communication methods, which can be applied to many different occasions. We provide PC software, which allows users to adjust the parameters of the module in real time, and reflect the real attitude of the inertial navigation module in real time through the 3D model.
# Features
1) Combination of 9-axis sensor and inertial navigation function.

2) On-board 3-axis gyroscope, 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis magnetometer and thermometer. Support USB/UART/CAN/SPI communication methods.

3) With its own algorithm, it can output Euler angles (Roll, Pitch, Yaw), quaternion, position, velocity, direction cosine matrix, acceleration, angular velocity, magnetic field vector.

4) Yahboom unique metal case can effectively help the module to dissipate heat and reduce the interference of the external environment.
